## Our Responsibilities

Organisers are responsible for clarifying acceptable behaviour standards and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Organisers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, changes, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any participant for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the school, project spaces, and public spaces
when an individual represents the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, post via an official social media account, or act as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by the organisers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise, unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the organisers at escape_school@lapp.in2p3.fr.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a deemed necessary and appropriate response to the circumstances. The organisers' team is obligated to maintain confidentiality concerning the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Instructors and organisers team members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
